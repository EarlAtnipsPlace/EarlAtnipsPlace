# Delta

Ah, the change is in the air and my blood begins to stir.  We have been greeted with the season’s first cold (cool) front.  This marks the beginning of the changes that are coming in terms of weather and fishing.  From the coast to the lakes of North Texas our fishing patterns begin to shift for both targeted species and techniques.

 

Some folks to our North would argue that we do not have seasons here in Texas but they just cannot seem to appreciate the small subtleties that are noticeable by us natives.  From mid July to mid Aug the usual calm warm to hot weather pattern settles in over North Texas with many days in the 100s and little or no rain.  For some it is tormenting month but it also has its beauty.  As mid to late August approaches one can begin to sense the changes as the stillness of morning and evenings begin to have a bit more wind and one can sense the difference.  For me this is the first signal of the change of our season.  The pressure gradients begin to build and eventually the first cool front makes its passage known.  Sometimes the first one peters out over North or Central Texas sometimes it comes in with enough muster to make it to the coast.  The front brings different odors which trigger a calm feeling yet also an eagerness for adventure and sense of preparation for the changes that are coming.  The fronts are the masters of change and I love being on the water when they show up.  Whether you are on a lake, river or in a bay along the coast it the arrival of the front is a sense of wonder mixed with trepidation.

 

Relish the change and get out there,
