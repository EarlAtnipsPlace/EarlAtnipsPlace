# 2015 Illinois River, OK Jan

Illinois River, OK

 Jan (16-19)

 Put in:  Chewey Bridge

 Take Out:  Sparrow Hawk camp

 Attending:  Jacob, Zachary, Alec and Earl Atnip, Dominick

 As my boys get older I am increasingly thankful for the times when I get them all together for trips like this.  Alec 20 now and is in school at OSU.  Jacob and Zachary are 15 now and sophomores in high school.  I have so much to be thankful for and trips like these remind me of that. 

Alec and his friend Dominick met us at the Sparrow Hawk campground Friday night.  They had secured some much appreciated firewood for that night.  We spent the night there then put on the river by 10am Saturday morning.  I had arranged a shuttle with Sparrow Hawk the week before.  The morning was a cool 19 deg but clear and partly sunny and warming quickly.  Our destination was an island that we had spotted during last year’s trip about 15 miles downriver.  The river was at about 450cfs so not to low but would have liked a bit more water.  We immediately began spotting bald eagles and the day would be filled with them, the most I have seen on any one trip.  We came to one slow stretch and we counted 5 at one time with several golden eagles also.  It must have been some productive water for that many in one quarter mile section of river.   The water is very clear and it is enjoyable just to let the current take you downriver while you watch the bottom and count the fish.  There are many logs in the river with lots of strainers so you have to keep your eye downriver or you might go swimming.  It had been very cold in the area for a stretch and we came across many hillside seepages which had formed wonderful looking ice flows. 

 

We stopped at the E0690 rd. bridge for some lunch then made our way another 2.1 miles downriver to the island by 2pm.  If you go river left around the island you will find a great spot to camp with easy pull up gravel bar, nicely spaced trees for hammocks or tents, a great sandy spot to put a fire, and tons of very close firewood.  We located the fire pit about 10ft from a pile of wood left from when the river was higher.  Of course this spot would not be where you want to be in a flood so always know your forecast.  I walked to the back of the island and spooked 4-5 white tail deer.  We all got to work setting up camp and Jake broke firewood into ready to use pile and he just kept piling it up with no intention of running out and we did not.  Dinner was venison stew that I had prepared at home and warmed it in a Dutch oven and there was not a single drop left.  All the full tummies led to profound sleepiness and I went first.  The camp location was so perfect with the gentle ripple of the river, not to soft and not too loud, that combined with the coyote howls put me right to sleep. 

 

Sunday Jan 18:

I woke up about 4am and stayed in my hammock as it was very cold out.  My breath had left ice on the outside of the sleeping bag and my butt was cold as I did not have any insulation below me in the hammock.  I finally got up at 4:40 and decided I needed fire in a hurry.  I had asked to boys to put on some big stuff on before they went to bed and leave some small kindling ready for me.  I got the fire re-started and then decided I needed a boost.  The boys found a couple of tires and had it next to the wood pile, so on it went.  Pretty soon there were shadows through camp and I was warm with my first cup of coffee going down and a hint of Firestone.  I had told the boys to sleep in and we were in no hurry to put on the river. I got my Dutch Oven out and filled it with several pre-maid foil wrapped breakfast burritos and put it by the fire and kept rotating it.  Pretty soon the smell of breakfast got everyone up and moving.  I had used river water for my first cup of coffee so I did not realize that all of the drinking water was frozen.  I knew it was cold and did not believe it when Jake said it was 15deg out, two additional thermometers verified though.  So about 8am we had burritos and on went another tire sending smoke signals upstream, but we were warm.  After letting the fire subside then dousing it and burying the ashes we packed up and got on the river by 10am.  Again we were treated with many bald eagles and a slow flowing gentle stream with no hurry to make our next nights camp.  I have not seen so many ducks on a river ever.  I bet we ran across 30 groups of 25-35 ducks each, especially the upper reaches of the river.   We made it to the Sparrow Hawk mid-point by noon and had some lunch then got back on for another 2 miles to our camp.  This was a sight that Alec had spotted in September on river right, a nice gravel bar with some larger sycamores across from a nice bluff.  Again there was plenty of firewood, no tires.  We made fire against a downed sycamore which was damp so it did not burn up right away and really reflected the heat.  I went on a hike through the woods and came across 3 herds of white tale with 25-30 deer in each heard. 

 Dinner was canned chili and grilled cheese.  Zach was determined not to get cold so he took to making a grass mattress.  He cut and piled and cut and piled until he had a 3’ x 6’ 12 inch high pile.  He put down his sleeping bag then piled grass on top.  He said he actually got warm during the night.  Alec and Dominick slept by the fire and Jake and I went to the hammocks. 

 

Monday Jan 19:

I got out of my bag about 5am and the got the fire back life which Alec and Dominick really appreciated it, they looked cold laying on that ground.  It was a much warmer night though with morning temps a balmy 25.  It is funny how you begin to get acclimated and really enjoy a 25 deg mornings.  As I sat by the fire and watched the stars give way to daylight and enjoyed the peace and serenity of my surroundings, I reflected on the enjoyment on being a father of 3 wonderful boys who apply themselves to everything they do, stay out of trouble and make good grades, help others, and have fun.  I hope they all remain the good friends they are today and stay close in the years to come and invite their old man to join them on trips with their children someday.   After a pot of oatmeal we packed up and were on the water by 8am for the short paddle to our take out.  We were loaded and driving by 10am.  Both Jake and Zach had homework to finish up so they appreciated getting going and home at a decent time.

 Not a single match or lighter was used the entire weekend.  All fires started with a fires steel and grass or leaves.   Water was filtered or boiled from the river so minimal water was carried.

 I have so many great photos from this trip it is hard to narrow down to a few, so here they are.
