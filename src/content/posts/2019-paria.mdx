# 2019 Paria

Start:  Buckskin Gulch trail head

Finish:  Lee's Ferry near Marble Canyon AZ

Along on Trip:  Earl Atnip, Dianne Echols,  Jacob Echols,  Jordan Echols, Susan Dean, Halie Dean, Dave ?

What:  This is a hiking trip from Buckskin Gulch trail head to Lee's Ferry at the confluence of the Paria and Colorado Rivers. 

Note:  If you are tracking our position on my Garmin InReach I will have it set to update 1/hour.  I will have it on while we are traveling from one camp to the other.  I will allow it to update twice when we reach our campsite for the night and then turn the unit off for the remainder of the day/evening.  Also, I do not expect it to update much at all  while we are walking through the slot canyons on Tuesday and Wednesday Oct 8-9.

If you are texting me, it must be very short.   I am charged for these texts as the go via satellite not cellular.   If I am getting to many texts I will turn the unit off.

Trip Report:

Coming soon
