I got to spend some time with my oldest son and a friend on the Buffalo River over the Memorial Day weekend. We met on Friday evening at the Ozark campground which was busy. Amber and I arrived at the campground about 9:30am and a good thing we did as it was full shortly after that. After setting up the tents and a shade shelter we made lunch and drove to the Hemmed in Hollow trailhead. This is a 2.5mile hike to a beautiful waterfall. We had cool damp weather with very few people on the trail. We ate lunch there then took a lot of pictures and enjoyed some time with no people around and the serenity of the day. The hike back to the truck was pretty much all uphill but we made it in less time than going down. Back at camp for some chips and salsa before our shrimp and salmon dinner with green beans and some peaches. Alec drove in about 8pm and we sat out until about 10:30 then called it a night.

Saturday we all got up and going pretty early as we had to pick up camp then drive to the outfitters. After the shuttle we launched by 10am. Our destination a gravel bar on river right just below Mt Hershey about 20 miles downriver. We took a break at Carver for some lunch and fill out water jugs then with a couple other quick stops along the way and made camp about 3:30 in the afternoon. We saw very few people on the river and no campers for the day, only day trippers.

We got camp setup and then relaxed with some appetizers and cold beverages. Amber spotted a beaver that swam up to some willows about 10ft from our kayaks and he or she was posing for pictures. Dinner was steak, baked potatoes and pineapple. Alec went to bed and Amber and I watched bats for a bit then she retired then I found my hammock and called it a day.

Sunday morning I managed to sleep until about 5:20 then sat out and drank some coffee then took off on a walk up a road for a couple of miles where I came across several deer and a turkey. I got back and cooked Amber and I some bacon, eggs and toast. We got on the river at 9am with our destination a large high gravel bar on river left just above Arnold island, about 20 miles. We came by skull rock and saw some campers and paddlers and took a few pictures then were on our way. We made the Woolum campground about 11:15 and took a short break and saw the campground was full and a pile of canoes from outfitters for the day paddlers they were putting on the river. We pulled out a few miles down for lunch on river right across from a large bluff. This would be a good campsite but need to be well informed on expected rainfall and river conditions as it is a little low. We put back on about 12:15 then made our camp about 2:30. Amber spotted an eagle’s nest along the way with an eagle tearing some prey apart in the nest. There were a lot of day paddlers and very few campers and we had the gravel bar to ourselves for the night. This is a really nice place to camp with a large bend in the river and beautiful bluff across the river. There is a large rock in the river so Alec and I decided to swim out and climb on top. A bit later Amber spotted a bobcat across the river coming down for a drink and then a couple of hours later she spotted either the same bobcat or another up on the bluff.

After all the last of the day paddlers came by about 7pm we finished our appetizers and started on dinner which was grilled garlic, onions and some smoked sausage with boiled potatoes and pineapple. All three of us lay out on the ground and watched the bats and stars for a bit then Alec and I went to our hammocks and Amber her tent. Alec and I did not put up tarps hoping there would be no rain that night, there was not and we got lucky one more time.

The morning was your typical Ozark foggy river bottom start to the day. After some oatmeal for breakfast and savoring the serenity a bit longer we packed up and got on the water about 9am. The paddle down to Tyler Bend was quick then onto Grinder Ferry and off the water by 10:15.

Here is a small sample of the pictures I took along the way.
